# GTA-Remake

# Quest-System made in one weekend:
Due to a lot of time shortage, I needed to come up with a fast, simple, reusable and expendable quest system.

For now there are just 3 different Quest-types
- Fighting
- Searching (For example a phone, dirty money, packeges, ect)
- Or just talking

But combined with some behaviours like scared or angry, you can make a lot of quests. 
It needed to be reusable, so I made it that you can change every parameter that you want in Unity itself:
